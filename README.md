#Text Summarization Tool

This Python script implements a basic text summarization technique based on word frequency analysis. The goal is to identify the most important sentences in a given text and return a summary containing the top five sentences. The method includes tokenization, stopword removal, word frequency calculation, and sentence scoring.
